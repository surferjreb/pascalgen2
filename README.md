## Description

> This program generates a pascal program example.  A little more than just
> a "Hello World" example.  It will generate some random example of Pascal
> variables and insert this into the program code.  This will output the code
> on the command line and create a Pascal program file.  This can then be
> compiled and executed in a Pascal compiler.
